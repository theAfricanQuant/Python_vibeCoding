    "### What is Aider? Why OpenRouter?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenRouter**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - A unified API for accessing multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "    - Simplifies the process of switching between models\n",
    "    - Prevents vendor lock-in by allowing easy migration as new models emerge or prices change\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to use OpenRouter, you can configure Aider to use individual model APIs directly. Here are some discounted (free/low-cost) models: https://aider.chat/docs/llms/cohere.html https://aider.chat/docs/llms/groq.html\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aider**: \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Open-source AI pair programmer\n",
    "  - Terminal-based, works directly in your development environment\n",
    "  - Deep Git integration for tracking AI-assisted changes\n",
    "  - Supports multiple AI models via OpenRouter\n",
    "  - Not really \"agentic\"—more like a collaborative coding partner\n",
    "  - Great for iterative development using the RECR framework\n",
    "  - Also great for getting a feel for how AI can assist in coding tasks (understanding contexts, generating code, fixing bugs, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other tools like Claude Code are more \"agentic\". However, I opine that you should use a tool that is more behind the scenes initially, so you can intuit how to best work with AI as a coding partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Aider\n",
    "\n",
    "Aider comes packed with features to accelerate your development:\n",
    "- **Multi-Model Support**: Works with top-tier models like Claude, GPT-4, DeepSeek, and even local models.\n",
    "- **Code Intelligence**: Builds an internal map of your entire codebase to make more informed decisions.\n",
    "- **Deep Git Integration**: Automatically stages and commits changes with sensible commit messages. All AI work is trackable and reversible with standard Git commands.\n",
    "- **IDE Friendly**: Can be used alongside your favorite editor or even monitor files for changes based on comments.\n",
    "- **Quality Tools**: Can be configured to automatically run linters and tests, fixing errors in a tight feedback loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Options\n",
    "\n",
    "Models seem to be evolving rapidly. Performance and price can change frequently. With OpenRouter, you can pick a model that fits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fall 2025 models I recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "- z-ai/glm-4.6\n",
    "- qwen/qwen3-next\n",
    "- google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview\n",

    "\n",
    "We will walk through the installation process and initial configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install Aider**: The recommended way is using `aider-install`, which sets up an isolated Python environment for you.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install aider-install\n",
    "    aider-install\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Get an OpenRouter API Key**: Sign up on the OpenRouter website and generate an API key. You can put it in your `.aider.conf.yml` file:\n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    api-key:\n",
    "    - openrouter=YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_HERE\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  *Specify Your Model**: Choose a model from OpenRouter that suits your needs. For example, to use Claude 3 Opus:\n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    model: openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.6\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Pro-Tip**: For cost and speed savings, consider enabling prompt caching if you use a model that supports it (like Claude or DeepSeek). You can do this with the `--cache-prompts` flag.\n"

    "\n",
    "When starting a new project, I like to have the boilerplate structure set up correctly (and not rely on AI to do it perfectly).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use `uv` for our project setup. It's a fast, modern Python package and project manager.\n",
    "- **Initial Setup**: A great way to start a new library project is `uv init --library <project_name>`. This creates the correct `src/` layout and a basic `pyproject.toml`.\n",
    "- **The `pyproject.toml` File**: This is the heart of your project's configuration. A common pitfall is that AI assistants can struggle with the exact syntax for newer tools like `uv` and dependency groups. Be prepared to manually review and correct this file. A good pattern for dev dependencies with `uv` is:\n",
    "    ```toml\n",
    "    [dependency-groups]\n",

    "### Git + Aider = Collaborative Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Aider works best with a git repository. It automatically commits changes made with AI assistance, creating a clear history of your collaboration. We'll see how this works in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Structure for AI Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start coding, we'll set up a simple project structure. A key best practice is to create a `context/` directory to hold our project \"brain.\"\n",
    "- `context/PRD.md`: Product Requirements Document (even a mini-one for our exercise).\n",
    "- `context/TASKS.md`: A numbered, ordered list of tasks to complete the PRD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"One-Shot\" vs. \"PRD\" Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A common temptation is to dump all your requirements into a single, massive prompt and ask the AI to build the entire project at once. This is the **\"one-shot\" approach**. While it sounds appealing, it often leads to:\n",
    "- Incorrect project structure (e.g., an extra nested directory).\n",
    "- Flawed configuration files (`pyproject.toml`).\n",
    "- Code with hardcoded logic to pass tests, rather than a correct implementation.\n",
    "- A long, expensive, and difficult-to-debug conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course champions the **\"PRD Approach\"**: structured, iterative development using the RECR framework. It's more reliable, teaches you better habits, and ultimately faster.\n"

    "\n",
    "Effective communication is key to getting great results from your AI pair programmer. This segment focuses on applying the RECR framework using Aider's chat modes to build a small project from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aider Chat Modes: `/ask`, `/code`, and `/architect`\n",
    "\n",
    "Aider has different modes to structure your conversation with the AI. A powerful workflow is to bounce between modes:\n",
    "- **`/ask` mode**: Use this for discussion, planning, and getting suggestions. The AI will not edit any files. This is perfect for the **R**equirements phase of RECR.\n",
    "- **`/code` mode**: The default mode where the AI makes changes to your files. Use this for the **E**xecute phase.\n",
    "- **`/architect` mode**: Uses two models (an \"architect\" and an \"editor\") for complex tasks. Useful for models that are strong at reasoning but weaker at editing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Live Coding: A Mini-Project with RECR and Aider Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a simple Python library for retirement planning from scratch, using Aider's modes to guide our RECR process. This library will eventually include functions to calculate future savings and retirement goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **R - Requirements: Define What You Want to Accomplish**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to give our AI developer a clear mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We'll ask Aider to help us create a `context/PRD.md` file. We'll prompt it: \"Help me draft a mini-PRD for a simple Python retirement planning library. It should have a prime directive and list the core features, like calculating the future value of an investment.\"\n",
    "2.  We'll continue: \"Now, create a `context/TASKS.md` file with a numbered list of small, manageable tasks to build this library using TDD. The first task should be to write a test for a function that calculates the future value of a series of regular contributions.\"\n",
    "4.  Once we're happy with the plan, we can move to execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **E - Execute: Let the AI Perform the Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we guide the AI to write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Tell Aider to run the next task. (You can refer to it by number from `context/TASKS.md`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C - Check: Review Critically and Provide Feedback**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where your expertise is crucial.\n",
    "1.  We'll review the AI-generated test file. Is the formula for future value correct? Does it test edge cases like a 0% interest rate?\n",
    "2.  We'll run the tests (e.g., with `uv run pytest`). They will fail initially, which is expected in TDD.\n",
    "3.  If the test logic is wrong, we'll provide specific feedback: \"The test should use the formula for compound interest on a series of payments, not simple interest.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **R - Repeat: Iterate and Refine**\n",
    "\n",
    "We close the loop and move forward.\n",
    "1.  Based on our feedback, we'll ask Aider to fix the tests.\n",
    "2.  Once the tests are correct, we'll mark the task as complete and update our `CURRENT_TASK.md` for the next task (implementing the `calculate_future_value` function).\n",
    "3.  We'll repeat the Execute -> Check -> Repeat cycle for each feature, such as adding a function to calculate required retirement savings.\n",
    "4. Often it is useful to clear out the context by using the `/clear` command."

    "### Advanced \"Checking\": Debugging and Refactoring\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Debugging**: When your code fails, paste the entire traceback into Aider (in `/code` mode) and ask for a fix. This is a core part of the \"Check\" phase.\n",
    "- **Manual Fixes**: Don't hesitate to step in and make corrections. Just because you're using an AI assistant doesn't mean you can't type or edit code yourself.\n",
    "- **Refactoring**: Ask the AI to improve code structure, add type hints, or optimize performance. This is also a \"Check\" activity—is the existing code good enough? How can it be better?\n",
    "- **Testing**: A great use of the \"Execute\" phase. Ask Aider: \"Write pytest unit tests for all the main functions in my application.\" In fact, I often have the PRD specify that I want to use TDD for development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizing Your Workflow: Cost, Context, and Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing your AI assistant effectively is key to staying productive and keeping costs down.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Context Management: Keeping Your AI Focused**\n",
    "\n",
    "A long chat can confuse the AI and increase costs. We'll discuss best practices:\n",
    "- **The Token Tax**: Every request costs money. Be mindful of prompt length and the model's output. Use Aider's `/tokens` command to see your context usage.\n",
    "- **One Task, One Session**: For a new, complex task, consider starting a fresh Aider session (`/clear` in Aider) to provide a clean slate. This prevents \"context pollution\" from previous, unrelated work.\n",
    "- **Drop Unnecessary Files**: Use the `/drop` command to remove files from the active context. If a file isn't needed for the current task, drop it to save tokens and reduce confusion.\n",
    "- **Context is King**: The `context/` command will show you the current context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `!uv run pytest` - will run the test suite and ask to put the results in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/test uv run pytest` - will run the tests and automatically attempt to fix any failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "I often like to use the `-x` flag (in pytest) to allow the AI to only have to deal with one error at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `-v` flag to get more verbose output if needed. This can also assist the AI in diagnosing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Switch Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all tasks require the most expensive model. Learn to optimize for performance vs. cost.\n",
    "- **Complex Logic / Architecture (Requirements/Execute)**: Use a powerful model like GPT-4 or Claude Opus.\n",
    "- **Bug Fixes / Tests / Docs (Execute/Check)**: I generally start with the cheapest model that performs decently. If it appears to struggle, I switch to a better one. Check out the Aider leaderboard for performance reviews.\n",
